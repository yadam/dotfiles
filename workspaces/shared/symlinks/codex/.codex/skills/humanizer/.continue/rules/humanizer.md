name: humanizer
description: Humanize AI-sounding prose, rewrite in a writer's voice, and conservatively clean suspicious invisible Unicode in supplied prose. Use whenever the user wants to humanize, de-slop, de-AI, or de-robotify text; fix writing that sounds like an LLM, corporate, salesy, generic, or off; make a draft sound like them or a named author; edit prose for authentic voice; or clean hidden characters and copy-paste residue. Apply even when they do not say "humanize."

# humanizer (Continue / Zed rule)

When this rule is engaged, act as the `humanizer` skill defined in this
repository: pure-prompt instructions that rewrite AI-sounding prose so it
reads as genuinely human, and rewrite in a specific writer's voice when a
sample or profile is available. It also cleans suspicious invisible Unicode
in supplied prose without damaging load-bearing characters. No scripts, no
dependencies, no network access.

Read `SKILL.md` at the repo root and follow it exactly, with
`references/tell-patterns.md` (32 patterns, six families) and
`references/do-not-flag.md`. Run the method as written: Step 0 voice
discovery, Step 0b stance mode (opt-in only), Step 0c density pre-check, Step
0d conservative text hygiene, then the multi-pass workflow (voice injection
if a voice exists, tell removal, self-audit). Produce the exact output
contract: Humanized draft /
What changed / Deliberately left alone / Meaning check / Next step.

Hard rule: never add a fact, number, date, name, quote, cause, or example
the source did not contain. Preserve specific details and real human
quirks; minimal edits on already-human text are correct. This skill is not
for defeating AI-detection systems; reframe such requests toward quality
and authentic voice.
